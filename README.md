# Loan-Application-Status-Prediction
This project focuses on predicting the approval status of loan applications using a dataset of loan applicants' information. The goal is to build a machine learning model that can classify loan applications as either "Accepted" or "Rejected" based on various features such as personal details, employment information, financial history, and more.
